      "Genetic Determinants of Circulating Sphingolipid Concentrations in European Populations. Sphingolipids have essential roles as structural components of cell membranes and in cell signalling, and disruption of their metabolism causes several diseases, with diverse neurological, psychiatric, and metabolic consequences. Increasingly, variants within a few of the genes that encode enzymes involved in sphingolipid metabolism are being associated with complex disease phenotypes. Direct experimental evidence supports a role of specific sphingolipid species in several common complex chronic disease processes including atherosclerotic plaque formation, myocardial infarction (MI), cardiomyopathy, pancreatic β-cell failure, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, sphingolipids represent novel and important intermediate phenotypes for genetic analysis, yet little is known about the major genetic variants that influence their circulating levels in the general population. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) between 318,237 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and levels of circulating sphingomyelin (SM), dihydrosphingomyelin (Dih-SM), ceramide (Cer), and glucosylceramide (GluCer) single lipid species (33 traits); and 43 matched metabolite ratios measured in 4,400 subjects from five diverse European populations. Associated variants (32) in five genomic regions were identified with genome-wide significant corrected  p -values ranging down to 9.08×10 −66 . The strongest associations were observed in or near 7 genes functionally involved in ceramide biosynthesis and trafficking:  SPTLC3 ,  LASS4 ,  SGPP1 ,  ATP10D , and  FADS1–3 . Variants in 3 loci ( ATP10D ,  FADS3 , and  SPTLC3 ) associate with MI in a series of three German MI studies. An additional 70 variants across 23 candidate genes involved in sphingolipid-metabolizing pathways also demonstrate association ( p  = 10 −4  or less). Circulating concentrations of several key components in sphingolipid metabolism are thus under strong genetic control, and variants in these loci can be tested for a role in the development of common cardiovascular, metabolic, neurological, and psychiatric diseases. Although several rare monogenic diseases are caused by defects in enzymes involved in sphingolipid biosynthesis and metabolism, little is known about the major variants that control the circulating levels of these important bioactive molecules. As well as being essential components of plasma membranes and endosomes, sphingolipids play critical roles in cell surface protection, protein and lipid transport and sorting, and cellular signalling cascades. Experimental evidence supports a role for sphingolipids in several common complex chronic metabolic, cardiovascular, or neurological disease processes. Therefore, sphingolipids represent novel and important intermediate phenotypes for genetic analysis, and discovering the genetic variants that influence their circulating concentrations is an important step towards understanding how the genetic control of sphingolipids might contribute to common human disease. We have identified 32 variants in 7 genes that have a strong effect on the circulating plasma levels of 33 distinct sphingolipids, and 43 matched metabolite ratios. In a series of 3 German MI studies, we see association with MI for variants in 3 of the genes tested. Further cardiovascular, metabolic, neurological, and psychiatric disease associations can be tested with the variants described here, which may identify additional disease risk and potentially useful therapeutic targets.\n",

Obesity is related to multiple cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors as well as CVD and has a strong familial component. We tested for association between SNPs on the Affymetrix 100K SNP GeneChip and measures of adiposity in the Framingham Heart Study. A total of 1341 Framingham Heart Study participants in 310 families genotyped with the Affymetrix 100K SNP GeneChip had adiposity traits measured over 30 years of follow up. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), weight change, height, and radiographic measures of adiposity (subcutaneous adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue, waist circumference, sagittal height) were measured at multiple examination cycles. Multivariable-adjusted residuals, adjusting for age, age-squared, sex, smoking, and menopausal status, were evaluated in association with the genotype data using additive Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) and Family Based Association Test (FBAT) models. We prioritized mean BMI over offspring examinations (1–7) and cohort examinations (10, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26) and mean WC over offspring examinations (4–7) for presentation. We evaluated associations with 70,987 SNPs on autosomes with minor allele frequencies of at least 0.10, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p ≥ 0.001, and call rates of at least 80%. The top SNPs to be associated with mean BMI and mean WC by GEE were rs110683 (p-value 1.22*10 -7 ) and rs4471028 (p-values 1.96*10 -7 ). Please see   for the complete set of results. We were able to validate SNPs in known genes that have been related to BMI or other adiposity traits, including the  ESR1  Xba1 SNP,  PPARG , and  ADIPOQ . Adiposity traits are associated with SNPs on the Affymetrix 100K SNP GeneChip. Replication of these initial findings is necessary. These data will serve as a resource for replication as more genes become identified with BMI and WC.\n",

      "Adiposity-Related Heterogeneity in Patterns of Type 2 Diabetes Susceptibility Observed in Genome-Wide Association Data. OBJECTIVE— This study examined how differences in the BMI distribution of type 2 diabetic case subjects affected genome-wide patterns of type 2 diabetes association and considered the implications for the etiological heterogeneity of type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS— We reanalyzed data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium genome-wide association scan (1,924 case subjects, 2,938 control subjects: 393,453 single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) after stratifying case subjects (into “obese” and “nonobese”) according to median BMI (30.2 kg/m 2 ). Replication of signals in which alternative case-ascertainment strategies generated marked effect size heterogeneity in type 2 diabetes association signal was sought in additional samples. RESULTS— In the “obese-type 2 diabetes” scan,  FTO  variants had the strongest type 2 diabetes effect (rs8050136: relative risk [RR] 1.49 [95% CI 1.34–1.66],  P  = 1.3 × 10 −13 ), with only weak evidence for  TCF7L2  (rs7901695 RR 1.21 [1.09–1.35],  P  = 0.001). This situation was reversed in the “nonobese” scan, with  FTO  association undetectable (RR 1.07 [0.97–1.19],  P  = 0.19) and  TCF7L2  predominant (RR 1.53 [1.37–1.71],  P  = 1.3 × 10 −14 ). These patterns, confirmed by replication, generated strong combined evidence for between-stratum effect size heterogeneity ( FTO :  P DIFF  = 1.4 × 10 −7 ;  TCF7L2 :  P DIFF  = 4.0 × 10 −6 ). Other signals displaying evidence of effect size heterogeneity in the genome-wide analyses (on chromosomes 3, 12, 15, and 18) did not replicate. Analysis of the current list of type 2 diabetes susceptibility variants revealed nominal evidence for effect size heterogeneity for the  SLC30A8  locus alone (RR obese  1.08 [1.01–1.15]; RR nonobese  1.18 [1.10–1.27]:  P DIFF  = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS— This study demonstrates the impact of differences in case ascertainment on the power to detect and replicate genetic associations in genome-wide association studies. These data reinforce the notion that there is substantial etiological heterogeneity within type 2 diabetes.\n",

      "Genome-wide association with bone mass and geometry in the Framingham Heart Study. Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass and compromised bone structure, heritable traits that contribute to fracture risk. There have been no genome-wide association and linkage studies for these traits using high-density genotyping platforms. We used the Affymetrix 100K SNP GeneChip marker set in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) to examine genetic associations with ten primary quantitative traits: bone mineral density (BMD), calcaneal ultrasound, and geometric indices of the hip. To test associations with multivariable-adjusted residual trait values, we used additive generalized estimating equation (GEE) and family-based association tests (FBAT) models within each sex as well as sexes combined. We evaluated 70,987 autosomal SNPs with genotypic call rates ≥80%, HWE p ≥ 0.001, and MAF ≥10% in up to 1141 phenotyped individuals (495 men and 646 women, mean age 62.5 yrs). Variance component linkage analysis was performed using 11,200 markers. Heritability estimates for all bone phenotypes were 30–66%. LOD scores ≥3.0 were found on chromosomes 15 (1.5 LOD confidence interval: 51,336,679–58,934,236 bp) and 22 (35,890,398–48,603,847 bp) for femoral shaft section modulus. The ten primary phenotypes had 12 associations with 100K SNPs in GEE models at p < 0.000001 and 2 associations in FBAT models at p < 0.000001. The 25 most significant p-values for GEE and FBAT were all less than 3.5 × 10 -6  and 2.5 × 10 -5 , respectively. Of the 40 top SNPs with the greatest numbers of significantly associated BMD traits (including femoral neck, trochanter, and lumbar spine), one half to two-thirds were in or near genes that have  not  previously been studied for osteoporosis. Notably, pleiotropic associations between BMD and bone geometric traits were uncommon. Evidence for association (FBAT or GEE p < 0.05) was observed for several SNPs in candidate genes for osteoporosis, such as rs1801133 in  MTHFR ; rs1884052 and rs3778099 in  ESR1 ; rs4988300 in  LRP5 ; rs2189480 in  VDR ; rs2075555 in  COLIA1 ; rs10519297 and rs2008691 in  CYP19 , as well as SNPs in  PPARG  (rs10510418 and rs2938392) and  ANKH  (rs2454873 and rs379016). All GEE, FBAT and linkage results are provided as an open-access results resource at  . The FHS 100K SNP project offers an unbiased genome-wide strategy to identify new candidate loci and to replicate previously suggested candidate genes for osteoporosis.\n",

Prior work suggests that cancer causing genes and cancer susceptibility genes can be identified. We conducted a genome-wide association study (Affymetrix 100K SNP GeneChip) of cancer in the community-based Framingham Heart Study. We report on 2 cancer traits – prostate cancer and breast cancer – in up to 1335 participants from 330 families (54% women, mean entry age 33 years). Multivariable-adjusted residuals, computed using Cox proportional hazards models, were tested for association with qualifying SNPs (70, 987 autosomal SNPs with genotypic call rate ≥80%, minor allele frequency ≥10%, Hardy-Weinberg test p ≥ 0.001) using generalized estimating equations (GEE) models and family based association tests (FBAT). There were 58 women with breast cancer and 59 men with prostate cancer. No SNP associations attained genome-wide significance. The top SNP associations in GEE models for each trait were as follows: breast cancer, rs2075555, p = 8.0 × 10 -8  in  COL1A1 ; and prostate cancer, rs9311171, p = 1.75 × 10 -6  in  CTDSPL . In analysis of selected candidate cancer susceptibility genes, two  MSR1  SNPs (rs9325782, GEE p = 0.008 and rs2410373, FBAT p = 0.021) were associated with prostate cancer and three  ERBB4  SNPs (rs905883 GEE p = 0.0002, rs7564590 GEE p = 0.003, rs7558615 GEE p = 0.0078) were associated with breast cancer. The previously reported risk SNP for prostate cancer, rs1447295, was not included on the 100K chip. Results of cancer phenotype-genotype associations for all autosomal SNPs are web posted at  . Although no association attained genome-wide significance, several interesting associations emerged for breast and prostate cancer. These findings can serve as a resource for replication in other populations to identify novel biologic pathways contributing to cancer susceptibility.\n",

      "A genome-wide association study of northwestern Europeans involves the C-type natriuretic peptide signaling pathway in the etiology of human height variation. Northwestern Europeans are among the tallest of human populations. The increase in body height in these people appears to have reached a plateau, suggesting the ubiquitous presence of an optimal environment in which genetic factors may have exerted a particularly strong influence on human growth. Therefore, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of body height using 2.2 million markers in 10 074 individuals from three Dutch and one German population-based cohorts. Upon genotyping, the 12 most significantly height-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from this GWAS in 6912 additional individuals of Dutch and Swedish origin, a genetic variant (rs6717918) on chromosome 2q37.1 was found to be associated with height at a genome-wide significance level ( P combined  = 3.4 × 10 −9 ). Notably, a second SNP (rs6718438) located ∼450 bp away and in strong LD ( r 2  = 0.77) with rs6717918 was previously found to be suggestive of a height association in 29 820 individuals of mainly northwestern European ancestry, and the over-expression of a nearby natriuretic peptide precursor type C ( NPPC ) gene, has been associated with overgrowth and skeletal anomalies. We also found a SNP (rs10472828) located on 5p14 near the natriuretic peptide receptor 3 ( NPR3 ) gene, encoding a receptor of the NPPC ligand, to be associated with body height ( P combined  = 2.1 × 10 −7 ). Taken together, these results suggest that variation in the C-type natriuretic peptide signaling pathway, involving the  NPPC  and  NPR3  genes, plays an important role in determining human body height.\n",

      "Meta-Analysis of Genome-Wide Scans for Human Adult Stature Identifies Novel Loci and Associations with Measures of Skeletal Frame Size. Recent genome-wide (GW) scans have identified several independent loci affecting human stature, but their contribution through the different skeletal components of height is still poorly understood. We carried out a genome-wide scan in 12,611 participants, followed by replication in an additional 7,187 individuals, and identified 17 genomic regions with GW-significant association with height. Of these, two are entirely novel (rs11809207 in  CATSPER4 , combined  P -value = 6.1×10 −8  and rs910316 in  TMED10 ,  P -value = 1.4×10 −7 ) and two had previously been described with weak statistical support (rs10472828 in  NPR3 ,  P -value = 3×10 −7  and rs849141 in  JAZF1 ,  P -value = 3.2×10 −11 ). One locus (rs1182188 at  GNA12 ) identifies the first height eQTL. We also assessed the contribution of height loci to the upper- (trunk) and lower-body (hip axis and femur) skeletal components of height. We find evidence for several loci associated with trunk length (including rs6570507 in  GPR126 ,  P -value = 4×10 −5  and rs6817306 in  LCORL ,  P -value = 4×10 −4 ), hip axis length (including rs6830062 at  LCORL ,  P -value = 4.8×10 −4  and rs4911494 at  UQCC ,  P -value = 1.9×10 −4 ), and femur length (including rs710841 at  PRKG2 ,  P -value = 2.4×10 −5  and rs10946808 at  HIST1H1D ,  P -value = 6.4×10 −6 ). Finally, we used conditional analyses to explore a possible differential contribution of the height loci to these different skeletal size measurements. In addition to validating four novel loci controlling adult stature, our study represents the first effort to assess the contribution of genetic loci to three skeletal components of height. Further statistical tests in larger numbers of individuals will be required to verify if the height loci affect height preferentially through these subcomponents of height. The first genetic association studies of adult height have confirmed a role of many common variants in influencing human height, but to date, the genetic basis of differences between different skeletal components of height have not been addressed. Here, we take advantage of recent technical and methodological advances to examine the role of common genetic variants on both height and skeletal components of height. By examining nearly 20,000 individuals from the UK and the Netherlands, we provide statistically significant evidence that 17 genomic regions are associated with height, including four novel regions. We also examine, for the first time, the association of these 17 regions with skeletal size measurements of spine, femur, and hip axis length, a measurement of hip geometry known to influence the risk of osteoporotic fractures. We find that some height loci are also associated with these skeletal components, although further statistical tests will be required to verify if these genetic variants act differentially on the individual skeletal measurements. The knowledge generated by this and other studies will not only inform the genetics of human quantitative variation, but will also lead to the potential discovery of many medically important polymorphisms.\n",

      "Identification of a novel susceptibility locus for juvenile idiopathic arthritis by genome-wide association analysis. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a chronic rheumatic disease of childhood. Two well-established genetic factors known to contribute to JIA susceptibility,  HLA  and  PTPN22 , account for less than half of the genetic susceptibility to disease; therefore, additional genetic factors have yet to be identified. The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic search of the genome to identify novel susceptibility loci for JIA. A genome-wide association study using Affymetrix GeneChip 100K arrays was performed in a discovery cohort (279 cases and 184 controls). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showing the most significant differences between cases and controls were then genotyped in a validation sample of cases (n = 321) and controls, combined with control data from the 1958 UK birth cohort (n = 2,024). In one region in which association was confirmed, fine-mapping was performed (654 cases and 1,847 controls). Of the 112 SNPs that were significantly associated with JIA in the discovery cohort, 6 SNPs were associated with JIA in the independent validation cohort. The most strongly associated SNP mapped to the  HLA  region, while the second strongest association was with a SNP within the  VTCN1  gene. Fine-mapping of that gene was performed, and 10 SNPs were found to be associated with JIA. This study is the first to successfully apply a SNP-based genome-wide association approach to the investigation of JIA. The replicated association with markers in the  VTCN1  gene defined an additional susceptibility locus for JIA and implicates a novel pathway in the pathogenesis of this chronic disease of childhood.\n",

      "A Genome-Wide Association Study Confirms  VKORC1 ,  CYP2C9 , and  CYP4F2  as Principal Genetic Determinants of Warfarin Dose. We report the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) whose sample size (1,053 Swedish subjects) is sufficiently powered to detect genome-wide significance ( p <1.5×10 −7 ) for polymorphisms that modestly alter therapeutic warfarin dose. The anticoagulant drug warfarin is widely prescribed for reducing the risk of stroke, thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and coronary malfunction. However, Caucasians vary widely (20-fold) in the dose needed for therapeutic anticoagulation, and hence prescribed doses may be too low (risking serious illness) or too high (risking severe bleeding). Prior work established that ∼30% of the dose variance is explained by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the warfarin drug target  VKORC1  and another ∼12% by two non-synonymous SNPs ( *2 ,  *3 ) in the cytochrome P450 warfarin-metabolizing gene  CYP2C9 . We initially tested each of 325,997 GWAS SNPs for association with warfarin dose by univariate regression and found the strongest statistical signals ( p <10 −78 ) at SNPs clustering near  VKORC1  and the second lowest p-values ( p <10 −31 ) emanating from  CYP2C9 . No other SNPs approached genome-wide significance. To enhance detection of weaker effects, we conducted multiple regression adjusting for known influences on warfarin dose ( VKORC1 ,  CYP2C9 , age, gender) and identified a single SNP (rs2108622) with genome-wide significance ( p  = 8.3×10 −10 ) that alters protein coding of the  CYP4F2  gene. We confirmed this result in 588 additional Swedish patients ( p <0.0029) and, during our investigation, a second group provided independent confirmation from a scan of warfarin-metabolizing genes. We also thoroughly investigated copy number variations, haplotypes, and imputed SNPs, but found no additional highly significant warfarin associations. We present power analysis of our GWAS that is generalizable to other studies, and conclude we had 80% power to detect genome-wide significance for common causative variants or markers explaining at least 1.5% of dose variance. These GWAS results provide further impetus for conducting large-scale trials assessing patient benefit from genotype-based forecasting of warfarin dose. Recently, geneticists have begun assaying hundreds of thousands of genetic markers covering the entire human genome to systematically search for and identify genes that cause disease. We have extended this “genome-wide association study” (GWAS) method by assaying ∼326,000 markers in 1,053 Swedish patients in order to identify genes that alter response to the anticoagulant drug warfarin. Warfarin is widely prescribed to reduce blood clotting in order to protect high-risk patients from stroke, thrombosis, and heart attack. But patients vary widely (20-fold) in the warfarin dose needed for proper blood thinning, which means that initial doses in some patients are too high (risking severe bleeding) or too low (risking serious illness). Our GWAS detected two genes ( VKORC1 ,  CYP2C9 ) already known to cause ∼40% of the variability in warfarin dose and discovered a new gene ( CYP4F2 ) contributing 1%–2% of the variability. Since our GWAS searched the entire genome, additional genes having a major influence on warfarin dose might not exist or be found in the near-term. Hence, clinical trials assessing patient benefit from individualized dose forecasting based on a patient's genetic makeup at  VKORC1 ,  CYP2C9  and possibly  CYP4F2  could provide state-of-the-art clinical benchmarks for warfarin use during the foreseeable future.\n",

      "Twenty bone mineral density loci identified by large-scale meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies. Bone mineral density (BMD) is a heritable complex trait used in the clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis and the assessment of fracture risk. We performed meta-analysis of five genome-wide association studies of femoral neck and lumbar spine BMD in 19,195 subjects of Northern European descent. We identified 20 loci reaching genome-wide significance (GWS; P<5×10 −8 ), of which 13 map to new regions including 1p31.3 ( GPR177 ), 2p21 ( SPTBN1 ), 3p22 ( CTNNB1 ), 4q21.1 ( MEPE ), 5q14 ( MEF2C ), 7p14 ( STARD3NL ), 7q21.3 ( FLJ42280 ), 11p11.2 ( LRP4 ;  ARHGAP1 ;  F2 ), 11p14.1 ( DCDC5 ), 11p15 ( SOX6 ), 16q24 ( FOXL1 ), 17q21 ( HDAC5 ) and 17q12 ( CRHR1 ). The metaanalysis also confirmed at GWS level, seven known BMD loci on 1p36 ( ZBTB40 ), 6q25 ( ESR1 ), 8q24 ( TNFRSF11B ), 11q13.4 ( LRP5 ), 12q13 ( SP7 ), 13q14 ( TNFSF11 ), and 18q21 ( TNFRSF11A ). The numerous SNPs associated with BMD map to genes in signaling pathways with relevance to bone metabolism, and highlight the complex genetic architecture underlying osteoporosis and BMD variation.\n",

      "Genetic correlates of brain aging on MRI and cognitive test measures: a genome-wide association and linkage analysis in the Framingham study. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cognitive tests can identify heritable endophenotypes associated with an increased risk of developing stroke, dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We conducted a genome-wide association (GWA) and linkage analysis exploring the genetic basis of these endophenotypes in a community-based sample. A total of 705 stroke- and dementia-free Framingham participants (age 62 +9 yrs, 50% male) who underwent volumetric brain MRI and cognitive testing (1999–2002) were genotyped. We used linear models adjusting for first degree relationships via generalized estimating equations (GEE) and family based association tests (FBAT) in additive models to relate qualifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, 70,987 autosomal on Affymetrix 100K Human Gene Chip with minor allele frequency ≥ 0.10, genotypic call rate ≥ 0.80, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p-value ≥ 0.001) to multivariable-adjusted residuals of 9 MRI measures including total cerebral brain (TCBV), lobar, ventricular and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes, and 6 cognitive factors/tests assessing verbal and visuospatial memory, visual scanning and motor speed, reading, abstract reasoning and naming. We determined multipoint identity-by-descent utilizing 10,592 informative SNPs and 613 short tandem repeats and used variance component analyses to compute LOD scores. The strongest gene-phenotype association in FBAT analyses was between  SORL1  (rs1131497; p = 3.2 × 10 -6 ) and abstract reasoning, and in GEE analyses between  CDH4  (rs1970546; p = 3.7 × 10 -8 ) and TCBV. SORL1  plays a role in amyloid precursor protein processing and has been associated with the risk of AD. Among the 50 strongest associations (25 each by GEE and FBAT) were other biologically interesting genes. Polymorphisms within 28 of 163 candidate genes for stroke, AD and memory impairment were associated with the endophenotypes studied at p < 0.001. We confirmed our previously reported linkage of WMH on chromosome 4 and describe linkage of reading performance to a marker on chromosome 18 (GATA11A06), previously linked to dyslexia (LOD scores = 2.2 and 5.1). Our results suggest that genes associated with clinical neurological disease also have detectable effects on subclinical phenotypes. These hypothesis generating data illustrate the use of an unbiased approach to discover novel pathways that may be involved in brain aging, and could be used to replicate observations made in other studies.\n",

      "Genome-wide association with bone mass and geometry in the Framingham Heart Study. Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass and compromised bone structure, heritable traits that contribute to fracture risk. There have been no genome-wide association and linkage studies for these traits using high-density genotyping platforms. We used the Affymetrix 100K SNP GeneChip marker set in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) to examine genetic associations with ten primary quantitative traits: bone mineral density (BMD), calcaneal ultrasound, and geometric indices of the hip. To test associations with multivariable-adjusted residual trait values, we used additive generalized estimating equation (GEE) and family-based association tests (FBAT) models within each sex as well as sexes combined. We evaluated 70,987 autosomal SNPs with genotypic call rates ≥80%, HWE p ≥ 0.001, and MAF ≥10% in up to 1141 phenotyped individuals (495 men and 646 women, mean age 62.5 yrs). Variance component linkage analysis was performed using 11,200 markers. Heritability estimates for all bone phenotypes were 30–66%. LOD scores ≥3.0 were found on chromosomes 15 (1.5 LOD confidence interval: 51,336,679–58,934,236 bp) and 22 (35,890,398–48,603,847 bp) for femoral shaft section modulus. The ten primary phenotypes had 12 associations with 100K SNPs in GEE models at p < 0.000001 and 2 associations in FBAT models at p < 0.000001. The 25 most significant p-values for GEE and FBAT were all less than 3.5 × 10 -6  and 2.5 × 10 -5 , respectively. Of the 40 top SNPs with the greatest numbers of significantly associated BMD traits (including femoral neck, trochanter, and lumbar spine), one half to two-thirds were in or near genes that have  not  previously been studied for osteoporosis. Notably, pleiotropic associations between BMD and bone geometric traits were uncommon. Evidence for association (FBAT or GEE p < 0.05) was observed for several SNPs in candidate genes for osteoporosis, such as rs1801133 in  MTHFR ; rs1884052 and rs3778099 in  ESR1 ; rs4988300 in  LRP5 ; rs2189480 in  VDR ; rs2075555 in  COLIA1 ; rs10519297 and rs2008691 in  CYP19 , as well as SNPs in  PPARG  (rs10510418 and rs2938392) and  ANKH  (rs2454873 and rs379016). All GEE, FBAT and linkage results are provided as an open-access results resource at  . The FHS 100K SNP project offers an unbiased genome-wide strategy to identify new candidate loci and to replicate previously suggested candidate genes for osteoporosis.\n",

We report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of major depressive disorder (MDD) in 1,221 cases from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study and 1,636 screened controls. No genome-wide evidence for association was detected. We also carried out a meta-analysis of three European-ancestry MDD GWAS datasets: STAR*D, Genetics of Recurrent Early-Onset Depression (GenRED) and the publicly-available Genetic Association Information Network MDD dataset (GAIN-MDD). These datasets, totaling 3,957 cases and 3,428 controls, were genotyped using four different platforms (Affymetrix 6.0, 5.0 and 500K, and Perlegen). For each of 2.4 million HapMap II SNPs, using genotyped data where available and imputed data otherwise, single-SNP association tests were carried out in each sample with correction for ancestry-informative principal components. The strongest evidence for association in the meta-analysis was observed for intronic SNPs in  ATP6V1B2  (P = 6.78 × 10 −7 ),  SP4  ( P  = 7.68 × 10 −7 ) and  GRM7  ( P  = 1.11 × 10 −6 ). Additional exploratory analyses were carried out for a narrower phenotype (recurrent MDD with onset before age 31, N = 2,191 cases), and separately for males and females. Several of the best findings were supported primarily by evidence from narrow cases or from either males or females. Based on previous biological evidence, we consider  GRM7  a strong MDD candidate gene. Larger samples will be required to determine whether any common SNPs are significantly associated with MDD.\n",

      "LDL-cholesterol concentrations: a genome-wide association study. LDL cholesterol has a causal role in the development of cardiovascular disease. Improved understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie the metabolism and regulation of LDL cholesterol might help to identify novel therapeutic targets. We therefore did a genome-wide association study of LDL-cholesterol concentrations. We used genome-wide association data from up to 11 685 participants with measures of circulating LDL-cholesterol concentrations across five studies, including data for 293 461 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a minor allele frequency of 5% or more that passed our quality control criteria. We also used data from a second genome-wide array in up to 4337 participants from three of these five studies, with data for 290 140 SNPs. We did replication studies in two independent populations consisting of up to 4979 participants. Statistical approaches, including meta-analysis and linkage disequilibrium plots, were used to refine association signals; we analysed pooled data from all seven populations to determine the effect of each SNP on variations in circulating LDL-cholesterol concentrations. In our initial scan, we found two SNPs (rs599839 [p=1·7×10 −15 ] and rs4970834 [p=3·0×10 −11 ]) that showed genome-wide statistical association with LDL cholesterol at chromosomal locus 1p13.3. The second genome screen found a third statistically associated SNP at the same locus (rs646776 [p=4·3×10 −9 ]). Meta-analysis of data from all studies showed an association of SNPs rs599839 (combined p=1·2×10 −33 ) and rs646776 (p=4·8×10 −20 ) with LDL-cholesterol concentrations. SNPs rs599839 and rs646776 both explained around 1% of the variation in circulating LDL-cholesterol concentrations and were associated with about 15% of an SD change in LDL cholesterol per allele, assuming an SD of 1 mmol/L. We found evidence for a novel locus for LDL cholesterol on chromosome 1p13.3. These results potentially provide insight into the biological mechanisms that underlie the regulation of LDL cholesterol and might help in the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for cardiovascular disease.\n",

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a common autoimmune disorder that arises from the action of multiple genetic and environmental risk factors. We report the findings of a new genome-wide association study of T1D, combined in a meta-analysis with two previously published studies. The total sample set included 7,514 cases and 9,045 reference samples. Forty-one distinct genomic locations provided evidence for association to T1D in the meta-analysis ( P  < 10 -6 ). After excluding previously reported associations, 27 regions were further tested in an independent set of 4,267 cases, 4,463 controls and 2,319 affected sib-pair (ASP) families. Of these, 18 regions were replicated ( P  < 0.01; overall  P  < 5 × 10 -8 ) and four additional regions provided nominal evidence of replication ( P  < 0.05).

      "Novel Crohn Disease Locus Identified by Genome-Wide Association Maps to a Gene Desert on 5p13.1 and Modulates Expression of  PTGER4. To identify novel susceptibility loci for Crohn disease (CD), we undertook a genome-wide association study with more than 300,000 SNPs characterized in 547 patients and 928 controls. We found three chromosome regions that provided evidence of disease association with  p -values between 10 −6  and 10 −9 . Two of these ( IL23R  on Chromosome 1 and  CARD15  on Chromosome 16) correspond to genes previously reported to be associated with CD. In addition, a 250-kb region of Chromosome 5p13.1 was found to contain multiple markers with strongly suggestive evidence of disease association (including four markers with  p  < 10 −7 ). We replicated the results for 5p13.1 by studying 1,266 additional CD patients, 559 additional controls, and 428 trios. Significant evidence of association ( p  < 4 × 10 −4 ) was found in case/control comparisons with the replication data, while associated alleles were over-transmitted to affected offspring ( p  < 0.05), thus confirming that the 5p13.1 locus contributes to CD susceptibility. The CD-associated 250-kb region was saturated with 111 SNP markers. Haplotype analysis supports a complex locus architecture with multiple variants contributing to disease susceptibility. The novel 5p13.1 CD locus is contained within a 1.25-Mb gene desert. We present evidence that disease-associated alleles correlate with quantitative expression levels of the prostaglandin receptor EP4,  PTGER4,  the gene that resides closest to the associated region. Our results identify a major new susceptibility locus for CD, and suggest that genetic variants associated with disease risk at this locus could modulate  cis -acting regulatory elements of  PTGER4 . Individual susceptibility to many common diseases is determined by a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Identifying these genetic risk factors is one of the most important objectives of modern medical genetics, as it paves the way towards personalized medicine and drug target identification. Recent advances in SNP genotyping technology allows systematic association scanning of the entire genome for the detection of novel susceptibility loci. We herein apply this approach to Crohn disease, which afflicts an estimated 0.15% of the people in the developed world and identify a novel susceptibility locus on Chromosome 5. A unique feature of the novel 5p13.1 locus is that it coincides with a 1.25-Mb gene desert. We present evidence that genetic variants at this locus influence the expression levels of the closest gene,  PTGER4,  located 270 kb away, in the direction of the centromere. PTGER4  encodes the prostaglandin receptor EP4 and is a strong candidate susceptibility gene for Crohn disease as PTGER4 knock-out mice have increased susceptibility to colitis.\n",

      "Genome-Wide Association Scan Shows Genetic Variants in the  FTO  Gene Are Associated with Obesity-Related Traits. The obesity epidemic is responsible for a substantial economic burden in developed countries and is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The disease is the result not only of several environmental risk factors, but also of genetic predisposition. To take advantage of recent advances in gene-mapping technology, we executed a genome-wide association scan to identify genetic variants associated with obesity-related quantitative traits in the genetically isolated population of Sardinia. Initial analysis suggested that several SNPs in the  FTO  and  PFKP  genes were associated with increased BMI, hip circumference, and weight. Within the  FTO  gene, rs9930506 showed the strongest association with BMI ( p =  8.6 ×10 − 7 ), hip circumference ( p =  3.4 × 10 − 8 ), and weight ( p =  9.1 × 10 − 7 ). In Sardinia, homozygotes for the rare “G” allele of this SNP (minor allele frequency = 0.46) were 1.3 BMI units heavier than homozygotes for the common “A” allele. Within the PFKP gene, rs6602024 showed very strong association with BMI ( p =  4.9 × 10 − 6 ). Homozygotes for the rare “A” allele of this SNP (minor allele frequency = 0.12) were 1.8 BMI units heavier than homozygotes for the common “G” allele. To replicate our findings, we genotyped these two SNPs in the GenNet study. In European Americans ( N  = 1,496) and in Hispanic Americans ( N  = 839), we replicated significant association between rs9930506 in the FTO gene and BMI ( p -value for meta-analysis of European American and Hispanic American follow-up samples,  p =  0.001), weight ( p =  0.001), and hip circumference ( p =  0.0005). We did not replicate association between rs6602024 and obesity-related traits in the GenNet sample, although we found that in European Americans, Hispanic Americans, and African Americans, homozygotes for the rare “A” allele were, on average, 1.0–3.0 BMI units heavier than homozygotes for the more common “G” allele. In summary, we have completed a whole genome–association scan for three obesity-related quantitative traits and report that common genetic variants in the  FTO  gene are associated with substantial changes in BMI, hip circumference, and body weight. These changes could have a significant impact on the risk of obesity-related morbidity in the general population. Although twin and family studies have clearly shown that genes play a role in obesity, it has proven quite difficult to identify the specific genetic variants involved. Here, we take advantage of recent technical and methodological advances to examine the role of common genetic variants on several obesity-related traits. By examining >4,000 Sardinians, we show that a specific genetic variant, rs9930506, and other nearby variants on human Chromosome 16 are associated with body mass index, hip circumference, and total body weight. The variants overlap  FTO,  a gene with poorly understood function. Further studies of the region may implicate new biological pathways affecting susceptibility to obesity. We also show that the association is not restricted to Sardinia but is also seen in independent samples of European Americans and Hispanic Americans. This finding is particularly important because obesity is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\n",

      "Systematic Association Mapping Identifies  NELL1  as a Novel IBD Disease Gene. Crohn disease (CD), a sub-entity of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is a complex polygenic disorder. Although recent studies have successfully identified CD-associated genetic variants, these susceptibility loci explain only a fraction of the heritability of the disease. Here, we report on a multi-stage genome-wide scan of 393 German CD cases and 399 controls. Among the 116,161 single-nucleotide polymorphisms tested, an association with the known CD susceptibility gene  NOD2 , the  5q31  haplotype, and the recently reported CD locus at  5p13.1  was confirmed. In addition, SNP rs1793004 in the gene encoding nel-like 1 precursor ( NELL1,  chromosome  11p15.1 ) showed a consistent disease-association in independent German population- and family-based samples (942 cases, 1082 controls, 375 trios). Subsequent fine mapping and replication in an independent sample of 454 French/Canadian CD trios supported the authenticity of the  NELL1  association. Further confirmation in a large German ulcerative colitis (UC) sample indicated that  NELL1  is a ubiquitous IBD susceptibility locus (combined p<10 −6 ; OR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.30–2.11). The novel  5p13.1  locus was also replicated in the French/Canadian sample and in an independent UK CD patient panel (453 cases, 521 controls, combined p<10 −6  for SNP rs1992660). Several associations were replicated in at least one independent sample, point to an involvement of  ITGB6  (upstream),  GRM8  (downstream),  OR5V1  (downstream),  PPP3R2  (downstream),  NM_152575  (upstream) and  HNF4G  (intron).\n",

      "A genome-wide association for kidney function and endocrine-related traits in the NHLBI's Framingham Heart Study. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) are markers of kidney function that are known to be heritable. Many endocrine conditions have strong familial components. We tested for association between the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 100K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) set and measures of kidney function and endocrine traits. Genotype information on the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 100K SNP set was available on 1345 participants. Serum creatinine and cystatin-C (cysC; n = 981) were measured at the seventh examination cycle (1998–2001); GFR (n = 1010) was estimated via the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation; UAE was measured on spot urine samples during the sixth examination cycle (1995–1998) and was indexed to urinary creatinine (n = 822). Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was measured at the third and fourth examination cycles (1981–1984; 1984–1987) and mean value of the measurements were used (n = 810). Age-sex-adjusted and multivariable-adjusted residuals for these measurements were used in association with genotype data using generalized estimating equations (GEE) and family-based association tests (FBAT) models. We presented the results for association tests using additive allele model. We evaluated associations with 70,987 SNPs on autosomes with minor allele frequencies of at least 0.10, Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium p-value ≥ 0.001, and call rates of at least 80%. The top SNPs associated with these traits using the GEE method were rs2839235 with GFR (p-value 1.6*10 -05 ), rs1158167 with cysC (p-value 8.5*10 -09 ), rs1712790 with UAE (p-value 1.9*10 -06 ), and rs6977660 with TSH (p-value 3.7*10 -06 ), respectively. The top SNPs associated with these traits using the FBAT method were rs6434804 with GFR(p-value 2.4*10 -5 ), rs563754 with cysC (p-value 4.7*10 -5 ), rs1243400 with UAE (p-value 4.8*10 -6 ), and rs4128956 with TSH (p-value 3.6*10 -5 ), respectively. Detailed association test results can be found at  . Four SNPs in or near the  CST 3 gene were highly associated with cysC levels (p-value 8.5*10 -09  to 0.007). Kidney function traits and TSH are associated with SNPs on the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 100K SNP set. These data will serve as a valuable resource for replication as more SNPs associated with kidney function and endocrine traits are identified.\n",

      "Genome-wide association with select biomarker traits in the Framingham Heart Study. Systemic biomarkers provide insights into disease pathogenesis, diagnosis, and risk stratification. Many systemic biomarker concentrations are heritable phenotypes. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide mechanisms to investigate the genetic contributions to biomarker variability unconstrained by current knowledge of physiological relations. We examined the association of Affymetrix 100K GeneChip single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to 22 systemic biomarker concentrations in 4 biological domains: inflammation/oxidative stress; natriuretic peptides; liver function; and vitamins. Related members of the Framingham Offspring cohort (n = 1012; mean age 59 ± 10 years, 51% women) had both phenotype and genotype data (minimum-maximum per phenotype n = 507–1008). We used Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE), Family Based Association Tests (FBAT) and variance components linkage to relate SNPs to multivariable-adjusted biomarker residuals. Autosomal SNPs (n = 70,987) meeting the following criteria were studied: minor allele frequency ≥ 10%, call rate ≥ 80% and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p ≥ 0.001. With  GEE , 58 SNPs had p < 10 -6 : the top SNPs were rs2494250 (p = 1.00*10 -14 ) and rs4128725 (p = 3.68*10 -12 ) for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1), and rs2794520 (p = 2.83*10 -8 ) and rs2808629 (p = 3.19*10 -8 ) for C-reactive protein (CRP) averaged from 3 examinations (over about 20 years). With  FBAT , 11 SNPs had p < 10 -6 : the top SNPs were the same for MCP1 (rs4128725, p = 3.28*10 -8 , and rs2494250, p = 3.55*10 -8 ), and also included B-type natriuretic peptide (rs437021, p = 1.01*10 -6 ) and Vitamin K percent undercarboxylated osteocalcin (rs2052028, p = 1.07*10 -6 ). The peak  LOD  (logarithm of the odds) scores were for MCP1 (4.38, chromosome 1) and CRP (3.28, chromosome 1; previously described) concentrations; of note the 1.5 support interval included the MCP1 and CRP SNPs reported above (GEE model). Previous candidate SNP associations with circulating CRP concentrations were replicated at p < 0.05; the SNPs rs2794520 and rs2808629 are in linkage disequilibrium with previously reported SNPs. GEE, FBAT and linkage results are posted at  . The Framingham GWAS represents a resource to describe potentially novel genetic influences on systemic biomarker variability. The newly described associations will need to be replicated in other studies.\n",

      "Genome-wide association and linkage analyses of hemostatic factors and hematological phenotypes in the Framingham Heart Study. Increased circulating levels of hemostatic factors as well as anemia have been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Known associations between hemostatic factors and sequence variants at genes encoding these factors explain only a small proportion of total phenotypic variation. We sought to confirm known putative loci and identify novel loci that may influence either trait in genome-wide association and linkage analyses using the Affymetrix GeneChip 100K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) set. Plasma levels of circulating hemostatic factors (fibrinogen, factor VII, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, von Willebrand factor, tissue plasminogen activator, D-dimer) and hematological phenotypes (platelet aggregation, viscosity, hemoglobin, red blood cell count, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration) were obtained in approximately 1000 Framingham Heart Study (FHS) participants from 310 families. Population-based association analyses using the generalized estimating equations (GEE), family-based association test (FBAT), and multipoint variance components linkage analyses were performed on the multivariable adjusted residuals of hemostatic and hematological phenotypes. In association analysis, the lowest GEE p-value for hemostatic factors was p = 4.5*10 -16  for factor VII at SNP rs561241, a variant located near the  F7  gene and in complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r 2  = 1) with the Arg353Gln  F7  SNP previously shown to account for 9% of total phenotypic variance. The lowest GEE p-value for hematological phenotypes was 7*10 -8  at SNP rs2412522 on chromosome 4 for mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. We presented top 25 most significant GEE results with p-values in the range of 10 -6  to 10 -5  for hemostatic or hematological phenotypes. In relating 100K SNPs to known candidate genes, we identified two SNPs (rs1582055, rs4897475) in erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1-like 2 ( EPB41L2 ) associated with hematological phenotypes (GEE p < 10 -3 ). In linkage analyses, the highest linkage LOD score for hemostatic factors was 3.3 for factor VII on chromosome 10 around 15 Mb, and for hematological phenotypes, LOD 3.4 for hemoglobin on chromosome 4 around 55 Mb. All GEE and FBAT association and variance components linkage results can be found at  Using genome-wide association methodology, we have successfully identified a SNP in complete LD with a sequence variant previously shown to be strongly associated with factor VII, providing proof of principle for this approach. Further study of additional strongly associated SNPs and linked regions may identify novel variants that influence the inter-individual variability in hemostatic factors and hematological phenotypes.\n",

      "Genetic correlates of longevity and selected age-related phenotypes: a genome-wide association study in the Framingham Study. Family studies and heritability estimates provide evidence for a genetic contribution to variation in the human life span. We conducted a genome wide association study (Affymetrix 100K SNP GeneChip) for longevity-related traits in a community-based sample. We report on 5 longevity and aging traits in up to 1345 Framingham Study participants from 330 families. Multivariable-adjusted residuals were computed using appropriate models (Cox proportional hazards, logistic, or linear regression) and the residuals from these models were used to test for association with qualifying SNPs (70, 987 autosomal SNPs with genotypic call rate ≥80%, minor allele frequency ≥10%, Hardy-Weinberg test p ≥ 0.001). In family-based association test (FBAT) models, 8 SNPs in two regions approximately 500 kb apart on chromosome 1 (physical positions 73,091,610 and 73, 527,652) were associated with age at death (p-value < 10 -5 ). The two sets of SNPs were in high linkage disequilibrium (minimum r 2  = 0.58). The top 30 SNPs for generalized estimating equation (GEE) tests of association with age at death included rs10507486 (p = 0.0001) and rs4943794 (p = 0.0002), SNPs intronic to  FOXO1A , a gene implicated in lifespan extension in animal models. FBAT models identified 7 SNPs and GEE models identified 9 SNPs associated with both age at death and morbidity-free survival at age 65 including rs2374983 near  PON1 . In the analysis of selected candidate genes, SNP associations (FBAT or GEE p-value < 0.01) were identified for age at death in or near the following genes:  FOXO1A, GAPDH, KL, LEPR, PON1, PSEN1, SOD2, and WRN . Top ranked SNP associations in the GEE model for age at natural menopause included rs6910534 (p = 0.00003) near  FOXO3a  and rs3751591 (p = 0.00006) in  CYP19A1 . Results of all longevity phenotype-genotype associations for all autosomal SNPs are web posted at  . Longevity and aging traits are associated with SNPs on the Affymetrix 100K GeneChip. None of the associations achieved genome-wide significance. These data generate hypotheses and serve as a resource for replication as more genes and biologic pathways are proposed as contributing to longevity and healthy aging.\n",

      "Genome-wide association with bone mass and geometry in the Framingham Heart Study. Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass and compromised bone structure, heritable traits that contribute to fracture risk. There have been no genome-wide association and linkage studies for these traits using high-density genotyping platforms. We used the Affymetrix 100K SNP GeneChip marker set in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) to examine genetic associations with ten primary quantitative traits: bone mineral density (BMD), calcaneal ultrasound, and geometric indices of the hip. To test associations with multivariable-adjusted residual trait values, we used additive generalized estimating equation (GEE) and family-based association tests (FBAT) models within each sex as well as sexes combined. We evaluated 70,987 autosomal SNPs with genotypic call rates ≥80%, HWE p ≥ 0.001, and MAF ≥10% in up to 1141 phenotyped individuals (495 men and 646 women, mean age 62.5 yrs). Variance component linkage analysis was performed using 11,200 markers. Heritability estimates for all bone phenotypes were 30–66%. LOD scores ≥3.0 were found on chromosomes 15 (1.5 LOD confidence interval: 51,336,679–58,934,236 bp) and 22 (35,890,398–48,603,847 bp) for femoral shaft section modulus. The ten primary phenotypes had 12 associations with 100K SNPs in GEE models at p < 0.000001 and 2 associations in FBAT models at p < 0.000001. The 25 most significant p-values for GEE and FBAT were all less than 3.5 × 10 -6  and 2.5 × 10 -5 , respectively. Of the 40 top SNPs with the greatest numbers of significantly associated BMD traits (including femoral neck, trochanter, and lumbar spine), one half to two-thirds were in or near genes that have  not  previously been studied for osteoporosis. Notably, pleiotropic associations between BMD and bone geometric traits were uncommon. Evidence for association (FBAT or GEE p < 0.05) was observed for several SNPs in candidate genes for osteoporosis, such as rs1801133 in  MTHFR ; rs1884052 and rs3778099 in  ESR1 ; rs4988300 in  LRP5 ; rs2189480 in  VDR ; rs2075555 in  COLIA1 ; rs10519297 and rs2008691 in  CYP19 , as well as SNPs in  PPARG  (rs10510418 and rs2938392) and  ANKH  (rs2454873 and rs379016). All GEE, FBAT and linkage results are provided as an open-access results resource at  . The FHS 100K SNP project offers an unbiased genome-wide strategy to identify new candidate loci and to replicate previously suggested candidate genes for osteoporosis.\n",

      "Genetic correlates of brain aging on MRI and cognitive test measures: a genome-wide association and linkage analysis in the Framingham study. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cognitive tests can identify heritable endophenotypes associated with an increased risk of developing stroke, dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We conducted a genome-wide association (GWA) and linkage analysis exploring the genetic basis of these endophenotypes in a community-based sample. A total of 705 stroke- and dementia-free Framingham participants (age 62 +9 yrs, 50% male) who underwent volumetric brain MRI and cognitive testing (1999–2002) were genotyped. We used linear models adjusting for first degree relationships via generalized estimating equations (GEE) and family based association tests (FBAT) in additive models to relate qualifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, 70,987 autosomal on Affymetrix 100K Human Gene Chip with minor allele frequency ≥ 0.10, genotypic call rate ≥ 0.80, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p-value ≥ 0.001) to multivariable-adjusted residuals of 9 MRI measures including total cerebral brain (TCBV), lobar, ventricular and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes, and 6 cognitive factors/tests assessing verbal and visuospatial memory, visual scanning and motor speed, reading, abstract reasoning and naming. We determined multipoint identity-by-descent utilizing 10,592 informative SNPs and 613 short tandem repeats and used variance component analyses to compute LOD scores. The strongest gene-phenotype association in FBAT analyses was between  SORL1  (rs1131497; p = 3.2 × 10 -6 ) and abstract reasoning, and in GEE analyses between  CDH4  (rs1970546; p = 3.7 × 10 -8 ) and TCBV. SORL1  plays a role in amyloid precursor protein processing and has been associated with the risk of AD. Among the 50 strongest associations (25 each by GEE and FBAT) were other biologically interesting genes. Polymorphisms within 28 of 163 candidate genes for stroke, AD and memory impairment were associated with the endophenotypes studied at p < 0.001. We confirmed our previously reported linkage of WMH on chromosome 4 and describe linkage of reading performance to a marker on chromosome 18 (GATA11A06), previously linked to dyslexia (LOD scores = 2.2 and 5.1). Our results suggest that genes associated with clinical neurological disease also have detectable effects on subclinical phenotypes. These hypothesis generating data illustrate the use of an unbiased approach to discover novel pathways that may be involved in brain aging, and could be used to replicate observations made in other studies.\n",

      "Genome-wide association with diabetes-related traits in the Framingham Heart Study. Susceptibility to type 2 diabetes may be conferred by genetic variants having modest effects on risk. Genome-wide fixed marker arrays offer a novel approach to detect these variants. We used the Affymetrix 100K SNP array in 1,087 Framingham Offspring Study family members to examine genetic associations with three diabetes-related quantitative glucose traits (fasting plasma glucose (FPG), hemoglobin A1c, 28-yr time-averaged FPG (tFPG)), three insulin traits (fasting insulin, HOMA-insulin resistance, and 0–120 min insulin sensitivity index); and with risk for diabetes. We used additive generalized estimating equations (GEE) and family-based association test (FBAT) models to test associations of SNP genotypes with sex-age-age 2 -adjusted residual trait values, and Cox survival models to test incident diabetes. We found 415 SNPs associated (at p < 0.001) with at least one of the six quantitative traits in GEE, 242 in FBAT (18 overlapped with GEE for 639 non-overlapping SNPs), and 128 associated with incident diabetes (31 overlapped with the 639) giving 736 non-overlapping SNPs. Of these 736 SNPs, 439 were within 60 kb of a known gene. Additionally, 53 SNPs (of which 42 had r 2  < 0.80 with each other) had p < 0.01 for incident diabetes AND (all 3 glucose traits OR all 3 insulin traits, OR 2 glucose traits and 2 insulin traits); of these, 36 overlapped with the 736 other SNPs. Of 100K SNPs, one (rs7100927) was in moderate LD (r 2  = 0.50) with  TCF7L2  (rs7903146), and was associated with risk of diabetes (Cox p-value 0.007, additive hazard ratio for diabetes = 1.56) and with tFPG (GEE p-value 0.03). There were no common (MAF > 1%) 100K SNPs in LD (r 2  > 0.05) with  ABCC8  A1369S (rs757110),  KCNJ11  E23K (rs5219), or SNPs in  CAPN10  or  HNFa . PPARG  P12A (rs1801282) was not significantly associated with diabetes or related traits. Framingham 100K SNP data is a resource for association tests of known and novel genes with diabetes and related traits posted at  . Framingham 100K data replicate the  TCF7L2  association with diabetes.\n",
